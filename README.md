<h1 align = 'center'>Money Maker </h1> 




#### Project Goals

There are three types of coins:
```
A bronze coin is worth 1 cent
A silver coin is worth 5 cents
A gold coin is worth 10 cents
```
- What is the minimum number of coins that equals 98 cents?

It’s a hard question to answer in head. In this project I used **C#** to build a **Money Maker:** a program in which 
- a user enters an amount and gets the minimum number of coins that equal that value.

For example, 16 cents could be:

16 bronze coins,
3 silver coins and 1 bronze coin, or
1 gold coin, 1 silver coin, 1 bronze coin
16 cents, divided three ways

<p align=center>We’d like the last option because it uses the fewest coins.</p>

#### Project Goals

- In this project, I have used **C#** to write a **Mad Libs word game**! 

**Mad Libs** are short stories with blanks for the player to fill in that represent different parts of speech. The end result is a really hilarious and strange story. Above there’s an example of the **“Roses are Red”** poem changed into a Mad Lib.

>Mad Libs require: <br>
>A short story with blank spaces (asking for different types of words). <br>
>Words from the player to fill in those blanks.

<br>
For this project, I have provided the story, but it will be up to user to complete the following: Prompt the user for inputs. 
- It'll print the story with the inputs in the right places.
