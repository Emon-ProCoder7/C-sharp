#### Project Goals

- In this project, I have used **C#** to write a **Mad Libs word game**! 

**Mad Libs** are short stories with blanks for the player to fill in that represent different parts of speech. The end result is a really hilarious and strange story. Above there’s an example of the **“Roses are Red”** poem changed into a Mad Lib.

>Mad Libs require: <br>
>A short story with blank spaces (asking for different types of words). <br>
>Words from the player to fill in those blanks.

<br>
For this project, I have provided the story, but it will be up to user to complete the following: Prompt the user for inputs. 
- It'll print the story with the inputs in the right places.
