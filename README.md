<h1 align = 'center'>Money Maker </h1> 




#### Project Goals

There are three types of coins:
```
A bronze coin is worth 1 cent
A silver coin is worth 5 cents
A gold coin is worth 10 cents
```
- What is the minimum number of coins that equals 98 cents?

It’s a hard question to answer in head. In this project I used **C#** to build a **Money Maker:** a program in which 
- A user enters an amount and gets the minimum number of coins that equal that value.
<br>
For example, 16 cents could be:

16 bronze coins,
3 silver coins and 1 bronze coin, or
1 gold coin, 1 silver coin, 1 bronze coin
16 cents, divided three ways

<p align=center><strong>We’d like the last option because it uses the fewest coins.</strong></p>

#### Project Goals

Architects have big ideas – but big ideas can be expensive. How expensive? Depends on the size. …can be (approximately) broken into circles and rectangles. Let’s assume that tiles cost ₤180 each:

```
double tileCost = 180;
double totalCost = totalArea * tileCost;
```
Although the floor plan isn’t exactly one circle and rectangle, this approximation is good enough for estimating costs. 

- In this project, I have built a program that calculates the material cost for any architect’s floor plan.

#### Project Goals

- In this project, I have used **C#** to write a **Mad Libs word game**! 

**Mad Libs** are short stories with blanks for the player to fill in that represent different parts of speech. The end result is a really hilarious and strange story. Above there’s an example of the **“Roses are Red”** poem changed into a Mad Lib.

>Mad Libs require: <br>
>A short story with blank spaces (asking for different types of words). <br>
>Words from the player to fill in those blanks.

<br>
For this project, I have provided the story, but it will be up to user to complete the following: Prompt the user for inputs. 
- It'll print the story with the inputs in the right places.

<h1 align = 'center'>Exquisite Corpse </h1> 




#### Project Goals

In the game Exquisite Corpse, participants draw either a **head, body,** or **feet** of a **creature**. The players don’t know how their part of the body connects to the other two, until the drawing is finished and revealed.

For this project, I have written a program that,
- Mimics the Exquisite Corpse game. 
- Players will be able to randomly combine different parts of ASCII characters so they create a new creature.
